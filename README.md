#This is the repository for my thesis project for my advanced training courses
#This thesis project implements a solution based on YOLOv8 and a custom wrapper for this neural network, which has two functions for traffic sign detection 
#First function is real time traffic sign detection from cell phone camera 
#Second solution is traffic sign detection from historical videos from the DVR in the car, this feature is more for fun and not for serious work
